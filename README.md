# KOMA-PH-Inventory-and-Order-Management-System-Team
The rationale of creating this system is that it will assist KOMA PH in shifting to less manual work and a more coordinated, effective, and factual system. The implementation of such a system will allow the business to streamline operations, minimize human mistakes, increase customer satisfaction, and provide a stable basis on which the expansion will take place in the future. Another objective of the project is to show how web technologies can be used in addressing real-life management issues of business.
